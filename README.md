# Simpledb

A simple in-memory datastore for prototypes and other applications
where you just don't need a real database [yet]. Prototypes, testing
and small local applications come to mind.

## Usage

Don't. It's a database in ~100LoC. It works, but you should probably
get something else unless you're a lazy bastard like me.

If you must:

```Clojure
lein test
```
